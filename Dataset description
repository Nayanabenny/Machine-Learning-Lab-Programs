Several machine learning models were tested to predict depression based on the given attributes. The models evaluated include:

Logistic Regression

Random Forest Classifier

Support Vector Machine (SVM)

Among these, the Random Forest Classifier achieved the highest accuracy of 78.2%, making it the best-performing model for this dataset.
